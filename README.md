# Knowledge Management Playbook

This playbook is the artifact of a Partnership for Public Service IT Leadership project with an aim of capturing contributions and plays over the long term. For more information about the IT Leaders program, checkout  [https://ourpublicservice.org/issues/leadership-development/federal-it-leaders-program.php](https://ourpublicservice.org/issues/leadership-development/federal-it-leaders-program.php).

The project leverages the [US Web Design System](https://designsystem.digital.gov) and the [USWDS-jekyll](https://github.com/18F/uswds-jekyll) code base. Big thanks to the folks at the [US Digital Service](https://www.usds.gov/) and [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov/) for providing such great open source tools.
