# About
Our team came together while participating the the Federal IT Leaders program which is hosted by the Partnership for Public Service.
> Information technology is quickly becoming the government’s latest Catch-22. Federal agencies need IT systems to efficiently and effectively deliver services to the American people. But the more reliant they become on IT, the more vulnerable agencies become to cybersecurity attacks and data breaches.
>
> To maintain IT systems that are both effective and secure, agencies depend on IT leaders with superb technical skills and exceptional management capabilities. The Federal IT Leaders program empowers participants to manage inevitable IT complications and drive vital innovations to strengthen agency operations.
